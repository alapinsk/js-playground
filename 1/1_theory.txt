'Hoising' - is this behaviour that gives impression 
that the declarations in javascipt are somehow moved to the top
of the execution code. 
This is misleading! 
What is really happening is that browser serves javascipt 
in two phases: 
1) Creation - browser goes through code and creates space in memory whenever 
it stumbles upon function or variable declaration. 
2) Execution - executes line by line our javascipt code.
